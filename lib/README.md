# Root Lib Directory

This directory contains an older or incomplete version of the Flutter app structure.

**The main Flutter project is located in: `connect_jobs_mobile/`**

The files in this root `lib` directory are not part of the active Flutter application and may be:
- Legacy code from an earlier version
- Work-in-progress files
- Template files that were never completed

## Active Project Structure

```
connect_jobs_mobile/
├── lib/
│   ├── main.dart
│   ├── data/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── screens/
│   ├── theme/
│   └── utils/
├── pubspec.yaml
└── ...
```

## Recommendation

Consider removing this root `lib` directory to avoid confusion, or move any needed files to the `connect_jobs_mobile/lib/` directory.
